## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <hr>

### I'm Collins Ruto 

I am a self taught developer from Mombasa, Kenya. <br>
I'm well experienced in web design and software development and some bit of Android dev. <br>
My Languages are HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Python and still learning more. <br>

### What am I doing? 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a project to create a web application for developers going by DevsQuest. <br>
  It is ment to connect and build communities of developers where we can be able to organize and build working teams
for educational and development purposes. <br>
The project is part of my learning of react and when I'm I hope I'll be proficient enough.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also learning Reactjs an awesome JavaScript framework. <br>
Thereafter I will be working on some backends and databases.
