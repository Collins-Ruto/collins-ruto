## Hi I'm Collins <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">

<br>

I am a self taught developer from Mombasa, Kenya 🇰🇪. <br>
I'm well experienced in web design and software development, some bit of Android dev and learning more. <br>
My biggest drive is the hope to be an inspiration and mentor to upcoming developers and programers around the world. <br>
Did I mention I'm also a marine engineering student ?. Well that's what I do at the Technical University of Mombasa. <hr>

#### What is DevsQuest?

It is meant to connect and build communities of developers where we can be able to organize, link and build working teams
for educational and development purposes. <br>
I'll be building it gradually and adding new features with time, and hopefully launch 🚀 it soon.
In the end it should have games, challenges, collabs, blogs and a forum.
The project is part of my learning of react and when I'm I hope I'll be proficient enough.

#### A bit more

I love engineering, IOT, programming and computers. <br>
How did i start?, well it all started with an old IBM computer 🖥️ that we had at home back in the days.
Back then we only drew stuff with microsoft paint, but in the end, I grew curious of how it worked and everything about it.
And voila, here I am learning and developing the same thing that were but my curiosity.<br>
The little things and steps are key, keep learning and write it all down in code 😉
